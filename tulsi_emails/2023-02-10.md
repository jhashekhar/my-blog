I hope you’re doing well. It’s 5:49 am and you’re sleeping in your default sleeping position. I love this sight of yours, just like I love everything else about you. I’m watching you babe ;)



I cannot stress enough how lucky I feel being in love with you and the way you make me feel. I haven’t been with you physically, irrespective of that it feels as if I’ve known you for decades and it’s getting better everyday, everything feels natural and calm. Maybe it’s because I’m so smooth and charming (yes i’m praising myself, you’re lucky to meet me my dear love LOL). I know that you aren’t into gifts and the narcissist in me wonders “what can be a bigger gift to Tulsi than me” but for me quite honestly you are a gift sent for me by god and i wholeheartedly cherish that. I love you and this love will only get deeper with time.



Since I mentioned the word “physical” — can’t wait to meet you, and embrace you all over. Kiss you and lick you wherever, run my fingers through your hair and your thighs sometimes violently and sometimes lovingly. Pecking your neck, sucking and fondling your gorgeous, perfect breasts makes me lose my mind. I just can’t wait to exercise my authority all over your body, you’re belong to me after all. Anyway I should stop, see what you have done to me ;)



Babe you’re my beloved. You’re THE most beautiful, thoughtful, kind, honest and “solution oriented” person I’ve ever met and I feel lucky to call you my girlfriend or companion. 



Coincidences either big or small, they all make me smile like a child. It’s such a joy when you complete my words. How do you even do that babe? Dark magic from the lands of Baghpat?



I don’t have words to express how much you matter to me, I’m at loss of words but I will cheat and take one from your dictionary, Tulsi you’re my Ardhangini, yes you’re my Ardhangini and the phrase “love” feels severely inadequate at this very moment.



Tulsi violent the storm will be, will hold your wrist tighter. Colder the night gets, the warmer my hug will be. Darker the night gets, my resolve to bring light to you will get stronger. I will try my best to bring a smile to your face in the face of despair. I promise you my love.


I love you and I wish all your dreams come true.


With love


Yours,
Shekhar ji
