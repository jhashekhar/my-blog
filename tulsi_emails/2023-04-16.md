*Hi Wifey,*

I have been thinking about writing you for a while but couldn't come up something until now.


I have been hating the heat and humidity of Kolkata for last few days and thinking about how good Darbhanga is weather wise. Only thing i would miss right now in Darbhanga would be ice cream and misti dahi. Both of them aren't available at walking distance from home and it made me realise that I will have to drive more than 10 kms to get it.


I was wondering how would I bring it back, last time it leaked from the carry bag and spoiled our seats. This reminded me of the bag you carried in Jaipur that I gave you. We will keep it as long as we can. It reminds me of the time when my dad used to tell me about objects that he got before I was born and my child-mind would love those stories. I'm sure Uncle ji and Aunty ji would have shared similar instances with you.

We would be talking about little things like the story about jute bag, our love for misti dahi, or even comb with our kids as well.


So this thought was going through my head while you must be preparing your bed and your night ritual while my phone was charging and coping up with overheating.


I love you so much babe and while I was writing this email you jokingly asked me to promise that I would marry you in exchange for you teaching me the "art" of clicking candid pictures. ***So I promised you that I will marry you üòò***


Anyway until I learn the art you gotta put up with my "not so" candid clicks. I've attach the first one below.


It's surreal and beautiful what we have and what we dream about together. I never thought I would fall in love with someone this much, never thought I would care about someone who I'm involved romantically this much.


Everyday makes me confident about you. You beautiful face, your smile, your eyes, you pretending to be annoyed all of it makes me fall in love with you more everyday.


I don't know what to say other that I love you so much. Hahaha you just looked back, it's cute when you turn back to check in on me and I catch you doing that. We have been doing this for almost 4 months and are quite consistent with only couple of days where we didn't sleep together. So much consistency when we are so far away each other doesn't make me feel we are not in same room sometimes.


Okay I must end it now, otherwise I will keep on adding more words. There is just so much to say.


I love you Tulsi ‚ù§Ô∏è


PS - Not proof reading it, it's late just assume the grammar and spell error to be a result of emotions
